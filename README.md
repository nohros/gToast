# gToast

Gmail toaster for angularjs(http://angularjs.org/) applications.

gToast is small (~1Kb), has minimalistic API, highly customizable through themes
and has only angularjs as dependency.

### [Example](http://nohros.com/gToast)

## Install

You can download all necessary gToast files manually or install it with bower:

```bash
bower install gToast
npm install
grunt compile
```

## Usage

You need only to include ``gToast.js`` and ``gToast.css`` (as minimal setup) to you project and then you can start
using the ``gToast`` directives, controllers and services. For example in controllers:

```javascript
angular
  .module('myApp', ['gToast'])

  .controller('MyAppCtrl', function($scope, gToast) {
    $scope.clickToOpen = function() {
      gToast.open("Toast notification message");
    };
  });
```

## API

gToast service provides a easy to use and minimalistc API, but the same time it's powerful enough. Here is the list of
methods that you can use:

### ``.open(text, opts)``

Method allows to show a toast, creates a new toast on each call. It accepts a ``message`` string and ``options`` object
arguments.

#### Options:

#### ``controller {String}``

Name of the controller that will be used by toast dialog if necessary.

#### ``scope {Object}``

Scope object that will be passed to toast. If you use controller with separate ``$scope`` service this object will be
passed to ``$scope.parent``.

#### ``data {String}``

Any data that you want to be stored in controller's ``$parent`` scope, it could be stringified JSON as well. The
data will be associated with the ``gToastData`` property of the toast's scope.

#### ``theme {String}``

This option allow to control toast dialog look, you can use built-in [themes](https://github.com/nohros/gToast#themes)
or create your own styled toasts.

This example enables one of built-in toast themes - ``gtoast-default-theme``(do not forget to include necessary css files):

```javascript
gToast.open('Toast notification', {
  theme:'gtoast-default-theme'
});
```

This theme will be used as default if none was specified. This theme makes the toast looks like the one used in
GMail.

Check [themes] (https://github.com/nohros/gToast#themes) block to learn more.

#### ``timeout {Integer}``

This option specifies the time (in milliseconds) for how long the toast will be displayed. This example makes the
toast visible for 3.5 seconds.

```javascript
gToast.open('Toast notification', {
  timeout: 3500
});
```

### ``.close()``

Closes the toast that is currently visible. If there are no visible toasts on the page, this method does nothing.

### Directive

By default gToast is served with ``gToast`` directive which can be used as attribute for buttons, links, etc. All
``.open()`` options are available through tag attributes as well.

A simple button should look like this:

```html
<button type="button"
  g-toast
  g-toast-theme="my-gtoast-theme"
  g-toast-controller="MyToastController"
  g-toast-text="Toast notification"
  g-toast-timeout="3500">
  Show me the toast!
</button>
```

## Themes

Currently ``gToast`` contains two themes that show how easily you can create your own. Check ``example`` folder for
demonstration purposes.
